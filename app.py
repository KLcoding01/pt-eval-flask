Medical History/HNP:
Subjective: Pt reports upper extremity pain and is limiting ADLs. Pt would like to improve function and return to PLOF. Pt agrees to OT evaluation.
Pain:
Area/Location of Injury: R shoulder
Onset/Exacerbation Date: 3 weeks ago
Condition of Injury: Acute on chronic
Mechanism of Injury: Lifting
Pain Rating (P/B/W): 4/10, 1/10, 7/10
Pain Frequency: Intermittent
Description: Sharp, throbbing
Aggravating Factor: Overhead activity, reaching
Relieved By: Rest, ice
Interferes With: Grooming, dressing, bathing

Current Medication(s): See medication list

Diagnostic Test(s): MRI right shoulder

DME/Assistive Device: None

PLOF: Independent

Posture: Forward head, rounded shoulders

ROM: R shoulder flexion 100°, abduction 80°

Muscle Strength Test: R shoulder 3+/5

Palpation: TTP R supraspinatus

Functional Test(s): Unable to reach overhead

Special Test(s): (+) Impingement

Current Functional Mobility Impairment(s): Reaching, overhead activity

Goals:
Short-Term Goals (1–12 visits):
1. Pt will decrease pain to ≤2/10 during ADLs.
2. Pt will improve R shoulder ROM to 140° flexion.
3. Pt will improve strength to 4/5.
4. Pt will perform ADLs independently.

Long-Term Goals (13–25 visits):
1. Pt will maintain pain ≤1/10 with all activity.
2. Pt will achieve full ROM and strength in R shoulder.
3. Pt will return to all prior ADLs independently.
4. Pt will independently complete HEP.

Frequency/Duration: 2x/wk x 6wks

Intervention: Manual Therapy, TherEx, HEP training, ADL retraining

Treatment Procedures:
